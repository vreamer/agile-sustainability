### Why Agile?
Agile is a set of popular [principles](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html) in the software industry to help to cope with volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity (VUCA) during software delivery. The space of sustainability is a, if not more but equally, volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous environment. Given the urgency to reach carbon neutrality, the agile principles which serve well for the software industry could be used as a potential reference to frame solutions in sustainability.

Moreover, the [Agile Principles](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html) advocate that *Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.* This advocation results in heavy use of the concepts [User Center Designs (UCD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User-centered_design) and [Minimum Viable Products (MVP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) during software development. Both concepts ensure the software products provide user values as soon as possible. As a result, the business will develop a committed user base, as well as a healthy cash flow from the early MVP release to iteratively improve the products in the future. Similarly, the idea of UCD and MVP could provide businesses an angle to strategize solutions around long-term sustainability.

### Why Sustainability?
The news about the world's glaciers melting faster than expected is heart-rending. However, it's unclear how an individual can help to alleviate this problem. The solution to this global environmental issue comes from the collaboration of academics, business practitioners, policymakers, and investors. As a business practitioner who recently delivered a software solution that helps organizations move towards carbon neutrality, I would like to reach out to academics, policymakers, and investors to iteratively develop new frameworks and strategies based on existing challenges we see.
